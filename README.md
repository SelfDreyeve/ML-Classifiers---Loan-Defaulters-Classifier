# ML-Classifiers-Loan-Defaulters-Classifier
In this project I'm comparing different ML models to classify bank customers into two groups: PAID OFF and DEFAULTED.

First I preprocess the data and try to grab some basic idea about the dataset and what features might play an important role.

Then, I'm using four models:
-   K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
-   Decision Tree
-   Support Vector Machine
-   Logistic Regression
